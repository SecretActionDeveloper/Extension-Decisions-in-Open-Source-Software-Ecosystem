# Extension Decisions in Open Source Software Ecosystem
---

## Abstract
GitHub Marketplace, as an open source software platform, is rapidly evolving, with an average annual increase of 41.23% in new tools by new or existing providers. 
In such a dynamic software ecosystem (SECO), making informed decisions about market entry and product extension is critical for success and requires careful consideration. GitHub Marketplace offers an environment where developers can openly share tools for automating workflows in open source software. However, our preliminary analysis of this ecosystem revealed a significant functional redundancy among the provided tools in this SECO.\\
We employed a graph-based approach to analyze the functional relationships between 6,983 ``Continuous Integration" Actions and 3,869 providers. We investigated the birth of functionalities and their evolutionary trajectory over time by mining the version control history and different releases of the actions and identified early adopters. Understanding the dynamics of the GitHub Marketplace is crucial for developers and organizations aiming to innovate and remain competitive in this rapidly evolving environment. By identifying patterns of functional redundancy and tracing the evolution of tools, we provide valuable insights that can inform strategic decisions on market entry and product development. Our analysis of early adopters and the evolutionary trajectory of functionalities offers developers a roadmap for anticipating future trends and aligning their products with emerging needs.
